# Kernel-perceptron
A kernel perceptron implementation with polynomial and Gaussian kernels. Parameter optimization for the polynomial degree and Gaussian kernel width are done through 5-fold cross validation. To compare the kernel perceptrons performance, self-implemented k-Nearest Neighbour and Multi-Layer Perceptron algorithms are implemented using only the `Numpy` library.
